# MyRoster Component Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Show MyRoster for All Leagues**
- **Problem**: MyRoster was only showing for Dynasty/Keeper leagues
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed `isDynastyKeeper` condition from `RosterSidebar.jsx`
  - Removed `data?.is_dynasty_keeper` condition from `DraftView.jsx`
  - Now shows roster toggle button for all leagues

### 2. **Empty State for No Players**
- **Problem**: No clear indication when user hasn't drafted any players
- **Solution**: 
  - Added empty state in `MyRoster.jsx` when `totalPlayers === 0`
  - Shows friendly message: "You haven't drafted any players yet"
  - Includes icon and helpful text

### 3. **Duplicate Players Issue**
- **Problem**: Players showing up twice in roster
- **Solution**: 
  - Improved key generation for React components
  - Added unique keys: `starter-${player.player_id}-${player.starterType}-${index}`
