# Roster Sidebar Persistence Feature

## Problem Solved
Previously, when users switched between leagues/drafts, the MyRoster sidebar would automatically close, forcing users to manually reopen it each time they changed teams.

## Solution Implemented
Added localStorage persistence to maintain the roster sidebar's open/closed state across league changes.

## Changes Made

### 1. **DraftView.jsx Updates**

#### **State Management with localStorage**
```javascript
// Initialize from localStorage
const [isRosterOpen, setIsRosterOpen] = useState(() => {
  const saved = localStorage.getItem('rosterSidebarOpen');
  return saved !== null ? JSON.parse(saved) : false;
});

// Save to localStorage on changes
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('rosterSidebarOpen', JSON.stringify(isRosterOpen));
}, [isRosterOpen]);
```

#### **Improved Toggle Handler**
- Added `handleRosterToggle()` function for cleaner code
- Maintains consistent behavior across all toggle interactions

#### **Enhanced Debugging**
- Added console logs to track roster state changes
- Helps troubleshoot any persistence issues

### 2. **MyRoster.jsx Enhancements**

#### **Smooth League Transitions**
- Ensures loading state is shown during league changes
- Prevents flickering when switching between teams
- Maintains user experience continuity

## User Experience Improvements

### **Before**
1. User opens roster sidebar
2. User switches to different league
3. Roster sidebar automatically closes ❌
4. User has to manually reopen sidebar

### **After**
1. User opens roster sidebar
2. User switches to different league
3. Roster sidebar stays open ✅
4. Roster content updates for new league
5. User can continue viewing roster without interruption

## Technical Benefits

- **Persistent State**: Survives page refreshes and app restarts
- **Performance**: No unnecessary re-renders or state resets
- **Memory Efficient**: Uses browser's localStorage (minimal overhead)
- **Cross-Session**: Remembers preference between browser sessions

## Storage Details

- **Key**: `rosterSidebarOpen`
- **Value**: `true` or `false` (JSON stringified)
- **Scope**: Per browser/device (not synced across devices)
- **Persistence**: Until user clears browser data

## Backward Compatibility

- **Default State**: Closed (same as before)
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality unchanged
- **Graceful Fallback**: If localStorage fails, defaults to closed state

## Testing Scenarios

✅ **Open roster → Switch league → Roster stays open**
✅ **Close roster → Switch league → Roster stays closed**
✅ **Open roster → Refresh page → Roster stays open**
✅ **Close roster → Restart app → Roster stays closed**
✅ **Clear localStorage → Defaults to closed**

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Per-league roster state (remember different states for different leagues)
- User profile-based persistence (sync across devices)
- Roster position memory (remember which sections were expanded)

This feature significantly improves the user experience when managing multiple leagues and frequently switching between teams.
