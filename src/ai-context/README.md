# ü§ñ AI Context Files

This directory contains markdown files and documentation that are primarily used for AI assistant context and development workflows. These files are not part of the main user documentation but provide valuable context for AI-assisted development and maintenance.

## üìÅ Contents

### [GITHUB_README_SECTION.md](./GITHUB_README_SECTION.md)
**GitHub release section template** - Used for creating GitHub release descriptions and repository presentation.
- Download links and setup instructions
- Feature highlights for GitHub visitors
- Quick start guide for repository page
- Template for release announcements

### [INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](./INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)
**System integration documentation** - Technical guide for integrating components and understanding system architecture.
- Component integration patterns
- API integration examples
- System architecture notes
- Development workflow guidance

## üéØ Purpose

These files serve several purposes:

1. **AI Assistant Context** - Provide comprehensive context for AI assistants working on the project
2. **Development Templates** - Reusable templates for documentation and releases
3. **Historical Reference** - Preserve development decisions and architectural choices
4. **Integration Guidance** - Help with system integration and component interaction

## üîß Usage

### For AI Assistants
These files contain rich context about:
- Project structure and organization
- Documentation standards and formats
- Release preparation workflows
- Integration patterns and best practices

### For Developers
Use these files when:
- Preparing GitHub releases
- Understanding system integration points
- Following established documentation patterns
- Maintaining consistency across the project

## üìù Maintenance

- Files in this directory are updated as part of development workflows
- Content should remain focused on AI context and development guidance
- Templates should be kept current with project evolution
- Historical context should be preserved for reference

## üö´ What This Is Not

This directory is **not** for:
- End-user documentation (use `/docs/` instead)
- API documentation (use `/backend/` READMEs instead)
- General project documentation (use main `README.md`)
- Release-ready user guides (use `/docs/RELEASE_README.md`)
