# Dark Mode Investigation & Fixes

## Issue Identified
Some pages were not turning dark when dark mode was enabled due to:
1. **Multiple ThemeProvider instances** - Each app state had its own ThemeProvider
2. **Missing dark mode classes** - Several components lacked `dark:` variants

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed ThemeProvider Architecture
- **Problem**: ThemeProvider was wrapped around each individual component return in App.jsx
- **Solution**: Created single ThemeProvider wrapper around entire App component
- **File**: `src/App.jsx`

### 2. Updated Core Page Components
- **LoadingState.jsx**: Added `dark:bg-gray-900` to main container, `dark:text-white` to headings
- **ErrorState.jsx**: Added `dark:bg-gray-900` to main container, `dark:text-white` to headings  
- **DraftView.jsx**: Added `dark:bg-gray-900` to main container, updated roster toggle button

### 3. Updated UI Components
- **ConnectionStatus.jsx**: Added dark variants for error/success states
- **DraftFooter.jsx**: Added `dark:text-gray-400` to footer text
- **PlayerCard.jsx**: Added dark variants for backgrounds, text, and icons
- **PositionSection.jsx**: Added dark variants for color badges and empty states

### 4. Enhanced CSS Classes
- Updated position badges with dark variants in `index.css`
- Added comprehensive dark mode support for all UI elements

## Components Now Supporting Dark Mode
✅ UserSetup (initial setup page)
✅ LoadingState (loading screen)
✅ ErrorState (error screen)  
✅ DraftView (main draft page)
✅ DraftHeader (header with settings)
✅ SettingsModal (dark mode toggle)
✅ ConnectionStatus (connection indicators)
✅ DraftFooter (footer info)
✅ PlayerCard (player cards)
✅ PositionSection (position groups)

## Testing
1. Navigate between different app states (setup → loading → draft view)
2. Toggle dark mode in settings
3. Verify all pages respect the theme setting
4. Check that theme persists across page refreshes

## Result
All pages now properly support dark mode with consistent theming across the entire application.
